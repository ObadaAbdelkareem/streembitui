        <h4>What is Streembit?</h4>
        </br>
        <div>
            <p>Streembit is a decentralized, peer to peer (P2P) real-time communication system for humans and machines.Decentralize means that there isn't a middleman so every message goes directly to the intended recipient and to no one else.You can add contacts, send the messages and files to them, make an audio and video calls. 
            </p>
            <p>The system ensures data integrity using public-private key cryptography.The video and audio chat feature utilizes the WebRTC the protocol that allows a fully encrypted video and audio communication in a true P2P manner, without routing the conversation through of any central servers.
            </p>
            <p>Decentralised systems are the composite of their peers, and are always available as long as at least two peers are connected. A decentralized P2P system makes centralized high-cost server infrastructures obsolete.
