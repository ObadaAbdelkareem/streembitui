        <h4>Configure your Streembit</h4>
        <div>
            <p>If you want to use the Streembit network from your desktop computer, tablet or mobile device and communicate with other peers without using a central server you must allow inbound connections.</p>
            <p>Home connections are usually filtered by a router or modem. Streembit will request your router automatically configure itself to allow inbound connections to port 8905. Unfortunately, many routers don’t allow automatic configuration, so you must manually configure your router. You may also need to configure your firewall to allow inbound connections to port 8905. Please see the following subsections for details.</p>

            <div class="settings-helpitem-title">Enabling Connections</div>

            <p>If the Streembit application can’t automatically configure your router to open port 8905, you will need to manually configure your router. We’ve tried to make the following instructions generic enough to cover most router models; if you need specific help with your router, please ask for help on a tech support site such as SuperUser.</p>

            <p>Enabling inbound connections typically requires two steps, plus an extra third step for firewall users:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Giving your computer a static (unchanging) internal IP address by configuring the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on your router.</li>
                <li>Forwarding inbound connections from the Internet through your router to your computer where Streembit can process them.</li>
                <li>Configuring your firewall to allow inbound connections. This step mainly applies to Windows users, as Mac OS X and most Linuxes do not enable a firewall by default.</li>
                <li>Please refer to your router configuration document for port forwarding information.</li>
            </ul>
